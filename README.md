![Diagram](./payment.svg)

This project implements a robust payment processing architecture to handle high volumes of transactions with a focus on scalability, security, and reliability. 

1. The system integrates with Stripe as the payment gateway, ensuring secure and seamless transaction processing. 
All sensitive payment data is handled through Stripeâ€™s APIs to maintain compliance with PCI DSS.

2. Asynchronous Payment Handling:
Webhook-based architecture ensures real-time updates on payment statuses without blocking the main application flow. Since we're testing locally, webhook functionality cannot be used.

3. Database Scalability and Reliability:
Utilizes a master-master architecture for MySQL to handle large volumes of write and read operations during transactions.
Utilizes a master-master MongoDB architecture for user authentication, supporting high-concurrency scenarios.

4. Caching with Redis:
Reduces load on the database by caching frequently accessed data, such as user transaction histories.
Ensures high-speed data retrieval for a smooth user experience.
